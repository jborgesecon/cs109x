This course is dedicated to the concepts of data modeling, from nearest neigbor approaches and simple linear models to intermediate techniques such as ridge and LASSO. 
Model Selection, Avoid Overfitting, and some of the most common mistakes people make in data science.

1Â° Simple Linear Regression (cap 1, cap 3.1.3)

        Statistical Learning refer to various set of tools for *understanding data*. 
    These tools can be classified as 'supervised' and 'unsupervised':
        supervised: predicting or estimating and *output* based on one or more *inputs*.
            applied in business, medicine, astrophysics, public policy, etc...
        unsupervised: there are inputs, but no known output, but we can learn relationships
                      and strucutres from such data

        To better illustrate some of the concepts, there are three datasets used:
            Wages -> Continuous and quantitative output (regression problem)
            StockMarket -> categorical and qualitative output (classification problem)
            Gene Expression -> only input data, analysing according to observed characteristics (clustering problem)

        Ps.: The datasets can be found in 'from ISLP import load_data', then import the relevant content

        Historically, althought the 'Statistical Learning' is relativily new, various concepts were developed long ago.
    The method od *least square* was developed in the beggining of the 19th century, implementing earliest form of what
    we now call Linear Regression. Then, here is some of what followed:
        -> Linear Regression
        -> Linear Discriminant Analysis
        -> Logistic Regression
        -> Generalized Linear Model
        -> Classification and Regression Trees
        -> Generalized Additive Models
        -> Neural Networks
        -> Support Vector Machines

        Needed Knowlegde: 
            -> PreCalc
            -> GA
            -> Basic Linear Algebra
            -> Mathematical Notation

    So Far we have that:
        Understand the importance of descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive analysis;
        We need to identify if the situation represents a regression, classification or clustering problem;
        Decide which models will better suit the given problem;
        Perform a Cross-validation analysis to validade the fitting of the chosen models;
